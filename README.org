#+TITLE: Readme

This is an attempt of bringing to bring to emacs some [[https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron][Dendron]] features hand in
hand with [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][Org Roam]]

*Make sure you check the our [[https://github.com/vicrdguez/dendroam/discussions][Discussions page]] 
where we can talk about proposals and improvements for the project*

* Disclaimer
This is a work in progress project in a very early stage. However it is still
functional and safe to use in your org roam vault.

This code *only works with Org Roam v2* which is currently in public alpha.

As well I'm not an elisp programmer and this is my first code using this
language. Probably the code is not as efficient or elegant as it could be, but
feel free to point out improvements or even contribute to them.

* Why?
In my experience, pure zettelkasten is awesome for academic information, taking
notes on books, and articles that are full of abstract concepts that don’t
belong to any category but are inter-linked with other ideas.

However since I work in the IT industry, I take a lot of notes on software and
software architecture. This kind of information has a clear structure, a
structure that repeats between information that belongs to an specific context.
And here zettelkasten in my opinion is not the perfect fit.

I ended up having lots of notes like: data types in Java, data types in c…
Repeating information in the title to be able to find specific notes.

This kind of note taking is really useful for me, and I think it can be useful
for others which write about more structured information

This hierarchies helps grouping and branching notes that are strongly connected
but leaves the concept of atomic note intact, a note that you can still link
with others that are related. Also, makes finding this references faster among
all your notes.

In addition, having this little feature set does not get in your way if you want
to use just zettelkasten.

For this I got hooked on Dendron's concept of note taking but couldn't get used
to VSCode, so I decided to write some code to have some of its beautiful goodies
along with the awesome Org Roam features.

You can find more on the hierarchies rationale in the [[https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html][blog]] of Dendron’s creator

* Features
Hierarchies are just filenames separated by dots “.”, each subsequent hierarchy is child from the former. Something like:
=org.refile= -> refile is child of org
=org.refile.cfg= -> cfg is child of refile

Each child is a note, so we can have a folder-like structure, but much less rigid.

** Finding and creating notes
This emulates the Dendron's Lookup. Runing ~org-roam-node-find~ shows hierarchies
in the minibuffer. If the note does not exist, the input is used to populate a
new file.

The search list will show notes with the following format:

=this.is.a.hierarchy:Hello World=

Dendroam will truncate the last child of the hierarchy for the file (which is
indeed the slugified title) and will show the file title instead for better
readability.

For note creation you don't need to use hypens, dendroam will change spaces for
hypens for the file name, keeping the title correct:

Writing:

=proj.dendroam.notes on dendroam=

as input will result in:

file: =proj.dendroam.notes-on-dendroam.org=

Note title: =Notes On Dendroam=

Of course you can create notes without any hierarchy as you would normally do
with Org Roam

** Refactor hierarchies
Useful to move group of files to another hierarchy.

- Running ~dendroam-refactor-hierarchy~ will prompt you with the current file
  hierarchy so you can change it. This will refactor all the notes that share
  the same hierarchy as well
- Running ~dendroam-refactor-file~ will do the same as refactor hierarchy command
  but will change only the current file.

** Time notes
Time notes are sub-hierarchies of other notes that indicates the time, you might
want this notes under different other notes, journal notes are a great example.
In this case dendroam is integrated with org-roam-dailies, so we can still using the
current functions:

=journal.daily.2021.04.21=

Or hierarchy where you capture meetings:

=project.customer1.meet.2021.04.21.123020=
=project.customer2.meet.2021.04.21.183020=

This makes notes easy to sort and easy to find. You can create time notes under
any other note as well

Scratch notes are other way of looking at time notes. This type of notes are
just a dump bucket where you want to capture something on the fly. It is nothing
more than a top-level hierarchy with time:

=scratch.2021.04.21.183020=

Take a look at the example:

[[file:assets/dailies.gif]]

This notes are possible using org-capture through org-roam new capture
functions, so it is easy to creae new types of time notes.


* Configuration

To show hierarchies in the minibuffer you must change the org-roam display
template:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-roam-node-display-template "${hierarchy}:${title}")
#+end_src

In order to populate the title correctly you need to configure org roam capture
templates like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-roam-capture-templates
      '(("d" "default" plain
         "%?"
         :if-new (file+head "${slug}.org"
                            "#+title: ${hierarchy-title}\n")
         :immediate-finish t
         :unnarrowed t)))
#+end_src

An example dailies configuration that works with hierarchies:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
      '(("d" "default" entry
         "* %?"
         :if-new (file+head "journal.daily.%<%Y.%m.%d>.org"
                            "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n"))))
#+end_src

To allow scratch notes and time notes you need to configure a new variable
defined in the dendroam code called ~dendroam-capture-template~, that adds
more templates:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dendroam-capture-templates
      '(("t" "Time note" entry
         "* %?"
         :if-new (file+head "${current-file}.%<%Y.%m.%d>.org"
                            "#+title: %^{title}\n"))
        ("s" "Scratch note" entry
         "* %?"
         :if-new (file+head "scratch.%<%Y.%m.%d.%.%M%S%3N>.org"
                            "#+title: %^{title}\n"))))
#+end_src

If you want to show the current file hierarchy as an initial input when running
the find command, you can use this function and then bind it to a key
combination of your choice

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun dendroam-node-find-initial-input ()
  (interactive)
  (org-roam-node-find nil (if (buffer-file-name)
                         (file-name-base (buffer-file-name))
                         "")))
#+end_src

* Install

** Doom Emacs

*** Load from Disk

You can clone the repo and load the file into your config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load! "<path to dendrom.el file>")
#+end_src

Note that the code above is for doom emacs, I guess you can have the same effect
with ~load~ in vanilla emacs as well. All the help you can give me on how to
distribute the package is really apreciated.

*** Load via github recipe

Inside of your ~.doom.d/packages.el~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! dendroam
  :recipe (:host github :repo "vicrdguez/dendroam" :branch "main"))
#+end_src

This registers ~dendroam~ as a package to use in doom. Now inside of ~.doom.d/config.el~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! dendroam
  :after org-roam)
#+end_src

* Future plans
This code is something I use my self so I plan to keep improving it. This are
the things I have in my mind now.

*More Dendron features*:
- Schema support: I'm researching how to best approach this. Using YAML files
  like dendron does? Not sure about elisp support for YAML. Another option is to
  use elisp forms to define schemas and then load them. This is open to
  discussion of course and I would love to know ideas on this if you have any.
  Feel free to show them.
- Publishing: Having an easy and integrated way of publishing would be nice. I
  don't know too much about web technologies so again, help is really
  apreciated.

We can of course discuss about more dendron features can be useful in org
roam/emacs context.

*Dendroam specific plans*
- Try to keep compatibility with org roam, and if possible add compatibility
  with Dendron so people can use both (of course exporting org to markdown and viceversa)
- Some improvements to take advantage of the powerful emacs features.
